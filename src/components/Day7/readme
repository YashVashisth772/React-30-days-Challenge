This React.js app would be used as ui by a vet (as in a doctor for animals), to log the date and details of a pet visit to their clinic.

Concepts Explored:
- Forms with React
- Different field types including dropdown
- Using multiple refs

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
